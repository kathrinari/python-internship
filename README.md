# python-internship
the project was to patch minigame files together to make them playable

it is called an internship in the university's module book, but it is essentially a project 

the task was to patch all minigame files of the past "linguistic gaming with python" course together as one game and make it playable 

the minigame files are the project files from students which took the course

I also fixed problems in the student's code to prevent the program from crashing/generating errors
